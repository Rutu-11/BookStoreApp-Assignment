#Interactive Bookstore Assignment
It is an interactive Bookstore application developed using ReactJS. The project aims to provide users with a seamless experience to browse, search, and purchase books. It incorporates various pages/components such as Home, Book Listing, Book Details, Shopping Cart, and Checkout pages.

The ReactJS Full Stack Assignment utilizes several technologies and features to develop the interactive Bookstore application. Here are the key tech stacks and their features:

1. ReactJS: ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components. ReactJS offers a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), enabling efficient updates to the UI and enhancing performance.

2. React Router: React Router is a routing library for React applications. It enables navigation and routing between different pages or components within a React application. With React Router, developers can define routes, handle dynamic URLs, and manage navigation history.

3. Redux or React Context API: Redux and React Context API are state management solutions for React applications. They provide a centralized approach to manage application state, making it easier to share and update data across components. Redux follows a unidirectional data flow and uses a single global state, while React Context API provides a lightweight solution for managing state within a component hierarchy.

4. CSS or CSS Frameworks: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style and design the application's user interface. CSS allows developers to apply visual styles, layout positioning, and responsive design to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Alternatively, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI can be used to provide pre-built UI components and styling themes, streamlining the development process.

5. Git and GitHub: Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes to their codebase and collaborate with others. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories, providing features like code versioning, issue tracking, and collaboration tools. It allows developers to create a public repository for their project, host the codebase, and manage the submission and evaluation process.


These tech stacks and features combine to create a robust and interactive Bookstore application using ReactJS, providing a seamless user experience and efficient management of data and state.
